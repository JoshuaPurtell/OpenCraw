## Part A: Core Product and Release Features (Detailed What/How/Why)

| Feature | What | How | Why | Citation |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| AI assistant that performs real tasks | OpenClaw is positioned as an assistant that executes operational tasks (inbox cleanup, email, calendar, flight check-in). | User messages the assistant from chat surfaces; the gateway/agent/tool stack executes actions. | Delivers agentic outcomes instead of chat-only responses. | [Homepage](https://openclaw.ai) |
| Chat-app-native assistant interface | OpenClaw is designed to be used from chat apps users already use. | Connect channels to one gateway; messages route into agent sessions. | Removes friction by meeting users in existing communication flows. | [Homepage](https://openclaw.ai), [Chat Channels](https://docs.openclaw.ai/channels/index) |
| Self-hosted control model | OpenClaw runs on user-chosen infrastructure (local machine, homelab, VPS). | Deploy gateway on owned host and keep keys/config/data there. | Preserves data/control sovereignty vs hosted SaaS lock-in. | [Introducing OpenClaw](https://openclaw.ai/blog/introducing-openclaw), [OpenClaw Docs Home](https://docs.openclaw.ai/index) |
| Open source and community-driven development | Project is described as open source and community-driven. | Public repo and contributor workflows (`PR`, issues, sponsorship, templates). | Increases transparency, extensibility, and ecosystem growth. | [Introducing OpenClaw](https://openclaw.ai/blog/introducing-openclaw), [OpenClaw Docs Home](https://docs.openclaw.ai/index), [Submitting a PR](https://docs.openclaw.ai/help/submitting-a-pr) |
| Single gateway as system source of truth | Gateway is the central runtime for sessions/routing/channel state. | Chat channels, tools, nodes, UI surfaces all connect through the gateway. | Prevents split-brain state across clients. | [OpenClaw Docs Home](https://docs.openclaw.ai/index), [Session Management](https://docs.openclaw.ai/concepts/session) |
| Multi-channel simultaneous operation | One gateway can run multiple channels concurrently. | Configure each channel; gateway routes by source channel/session key. | Enables one assistant persona across personal and team comms. | [Chat Channels](https://docs.openclaw.ai/channels/index), [Channel Routing](https://docs.openclaw.ai/channels/channel-routing) |
| Plugin-based channel expansion | Channel and tool surface is extended via plugins. | Install plugins and register config/credentials per plugin. | Lets core stay stable while ecosystem adds new connectors. | [OpenClaw Docs Home](https://docs.openclaw.ai/index), [Plugins](https://docs.openclaw.ai/tools/plugin) |
| Multi-agent routing with isolation | Runtime supports isolated agent sessions per workspace/sender/context. | Session keys and routing rules map inbound events to isolated or shared sessions. | Prevents context bleed and enables specialization. | [Features](https://docs.openclaw.ai/concepts/features), [Multi-Agent Routing](https://docs.openclaw.ai/concepts/multi-agent) |
| Agent workspace model | Agent state/work happens in workspace on disk. | Workspace paths, memory files, and tool operations resolve there. | Makes agent execution auditable and persistent. | [Agent Workspace](https://docs.openclaw.ai/concepts/agent-workspace), [Memory](https://docs.openclaw.ai/concepts/memory) |
| Session lifecycle controls | Session reuse/reset/partitioning is policy-driven. | Configure `dmScope`, reset windows, channel/type overrides, and triggers. | Balances continuity with privacy/isolation requirements. | [Session Management](https://docs.openclaw.ai/concepts/session) |
| Secure DM mode for multi-user inboxes | Docs call out DM context leakage risk under shared-session defaults and provide secure isolation mode. | Set `session.dmScope` to `per-channel-peer` or stronger. | Reduces accidental cross-user context disclosure. | [Session Management](https://docs.openclaw.ai/concepts/session) |
| Context compaction | Long sessions are compacted when context windows tighten. | Compaction summarizes/rolls forward history at lifecycle boundaries. | Keeps long-running assistants usable within model context limits. | [Compaction](https://docs.openclaw.ai/concepts/compaction) |
| Session pruning for tool output | Runtime can trim stale tool results before inference. | `cache-ttl` pruning applies heuristics to tool results near inference time. | Reduces unnecessary token/caching cost and context bloat. | [Session Pruning](https://docs.openclaw.ai/concepts/session-pruning) |
| Markdown-first memory system | Durable memory is stored as Markdown files in workspace. | `memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md` + optional `MEMORY.md`; model writes to disk. | Ensures durable memory is explicit and inspectable. | [Memory](https://docs.openclaw.ai/concepts/memory) |
| Pre-compaction memory flush | Runtime can trigger silent memory write reminders before compaction. | Configurable `memoryFlush` emits agentic turn when thresholds hit. | Prevents losing durable facts before context compaction. | [Memory](https://docs.openclaw.ai/concepts/memory) |
| Vector memory retrieval | Semantic memory search is supported (local/remote embedding paths). | Build/update vector index over memory files with provider or local backend. | Improves recall when wording differs from original notes. | [Memory](https://docs.openclaw.ai/concepts/memory) |
| Channel breadth: core and plugin channels | Documented channels include WhatsApp, Telegram, Discord, Slack, Signal, Google Chat, Feishu, Mattermost, Teams, LINE, Matrix, Zalo, WebChat, and more. | Each channel has specific auth transport and routing setup. | Maximizes communication reach with one assistant runtime. | [Chat Channels](https://docs.openclaw.ai/channels/index), [llms index](https://docs.openclaw.ai/llms.txt) |
